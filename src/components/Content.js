                        Lviv (Ukrainian: &#1051;&#1100;&#1074;&#1110;&#1074;) is the largest city in western Ukraine,
                        and
                        the
                        seventh-largest
                        in Ukraine, with a population of 717,510 (2021 est.). It serves as the administrative centre of
                        Lviv
                        Oblast and
                        Lviv Raion, and is one of the main cultural centres of Ukraine. It was named in honour of Leo,
                        the
                        eldest son of
                        Daniel, King of Ruthenia.

                        Lviv emerged as the centre of the historical regions of Red Ruthenia and Galicia in the 14th
                        century, superseding
                        Halych, Che&#322;m, Belz and Przemy&#347;l. It was the capital of the Kingdom of
                        Galicia&ndash;Volhynia from 1272
                        to 1349, when it was conquered by King Casimir III the Great of Poland. From 1434, it was
                        the
                        regional capital of
                        the Ruthenian Voivodeship in the Kingdom of Poland. In 1772, after the First Partition of
                        Poland, the city became
                        the capital of the Habsburg Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria. In 1918, for a short time, it
                        was
                        the capital of the
                        West Ukrainian People's Republic. Between the wars, the city was the centre of the
                        Lw&oacute;w
                        Voivodeship in the
                        Second Polish Republic. After the German-Soviet invasion of Poland in 1939, Lviv became part
                        of
                        the Soviet
                        Union.

                        The once large Jewish community was sharply reduced in number by the Nazis during the
                        Holocaust.
                        For decades there
                        was no working synagogue in the city after the final one was closed by the Soviets. The once
                        predominant Polish
                        population was for the greatest part sent to Poland in the context of a population exchange
                        between Poland and
                        Soviet Ukraine in 1944&ndash;46.

                        The historical heart of the city, with its cobblestone streets and architectural assortment
                        of
                        Renaissance, Baroque,
                        Neo-classicism and Art Nouveau, survived Soviet and German occupations during World War II
                        largely unscathed. Due to
                        its Mediterranean aura, many Soviet movies set in places like Venice or Rome were actually
                        shot
                        in Lviv. In 1991,
                        Lviv became part of the independent nation of Ukraine.

                        The city has many industries and institutions of higher education such as Lviv University
                        and
                        Lviv Polytechnic. Lviv
                        is also the home of many cultural institutions, including a philharmonic orchestra and the
                        Lviv
                        Theatre of Opera and
                        Ballet. The historic city centre is on the UNESCO World Heritage List.
